# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this analysis, we look at what other users have done for their funding campaigns and based on this data, establish what goal amount and what time frame to work with.
### Purpose
Client wishes to start a kickstarter funding campaign, but is concerned over success rate. through our observations we will determine the best plan of action.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
All in all, the best month to start a kickstarter campaign is May. December was shown to be the worst one.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The conclusion I came to was that either we want long campaigns that are far reaching for the higher goals in order to get favorable outcomes.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The nested if statement is cumbersome and very difficult to debug within Excel. Also, within any other language, you wouldn't do this. You would write a CASE statement.

## Results

#### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The month of May seems to be a very good month to launch a play campaign.
The months having an “R” in them have the greatest likelihood of failing play campaigns.

#### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The percentage of successful campaigns in the play sub-category have a goal of $5,000 or less.
The play campaigns with a high percentage of failure were over $25,000.

#### What are some limitations of this dataset?
Wouldn’t it have been nice to know what the MIN and MAX contribution of each subcategory was? How about whether there was other advertising or insentive utilized to promote the campaigns?

#### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- I would like my graphs to show a story. What kind of story could be told if we used deadlines? We have explored the length of a campaign as having the effect on outcomes. Looking at the deadlines to see if they might be an outcome factor might prove to be of some worth.
