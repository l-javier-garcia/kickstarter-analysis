## Overview of Project
In this analysis, we look at what other users have done for their funding campaigns and based on this data, establish what goal amount and what time frame to work with.
### Purpose
Client wishes to start a kickstarter funding campaign, but is concerned over success rate. through our observations we will determine the best plan of action.
## Analysis and Challenges

All in all, the best month to start a kickstarter campaign is May. December was shown to be the worst one.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The conclusion I came to was that either we want long campaigns that are far reaching for the higher goals in order to get favorable outcomes.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
